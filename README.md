# Obesity Prediction App

## Overview
The Obesity Prediction App is a data science project focused on estimating obesity levels based on user habits and physical traits. The machine learning model is trained on a diverse dataset from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, providing personalized predictions for individuals in the age range of 14 to 61 with accuracy higher than 90%.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to predict obesity levels based on 17 attributes related to eating habits and physical condition.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive app interface for seamless input of user data and retrieval of personalized predictions.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Prioritizes data security and follows ethical handling practices to ensure user privacy.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 2111 records, collected through a web platform survey. The dataset includes information on attributes such as frequent consumption of high-caloric food, consumption of vegetables, number of main meals, physical activity frequency, and more.
